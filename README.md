# Papyrus "Hello, world!"

---

The simplest possible Papyrus plugin for Skyrim.

## What does it do?

As soon as you begin a game or load an existing game, it pops up a "Hello, world!" message.

## Requirements

- [Skyrim Special Edition: Creation Kit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/) from Steam  
  (_provides the Papyrus Compiler and required game scripts_)

### Optional but *Highly Recommended*
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
  (_with the [Papyrus extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joelday.papyrus-lang-vscode) installed_)

## Creation Kit

> **Creation Kit** requires [Skyrim Special Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/) (_or "[Skyrim Anniverary Edition](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/626153/)"_)  
> It is currently (2022) only distributed via Steam (_e.g. not available via GOG_)
> It can be found in your Steam library under "**Software**"

> If you have the old [The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/) "Legendary Edition" of Skyrim on Steam,  
> you should have access to the classic edition of Creation Kit under "**Tools**"
